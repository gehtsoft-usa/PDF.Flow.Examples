**WarehouseShipmentReport** project is an example of the home rent contract generation. The example demonstrates creation of a multi-page text document. The document includes a repeating footer with automatic page numeration. The footer is made of two distinctive sections with different content for the initials area on all pages of the contract, except the page with full signatures. Additionally, this example demonstrates how to use Word-like tabulation and how to work with JSON as a data source. Finally, we demonstrate how to easily add barcodes (GS1-128) for each product in the report using the PDFFlowLib.Barcodes extension library.
