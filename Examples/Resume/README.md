The Resume project is an example of the resume/CV generation. The example demonstrates a simple multi-page document that includes right repeating area on both pages (even and odd) with the same content and document flow area on the left side of page. This example also demonstrates the usage of the vertical line (between the document flow and the repeating area) and clickable URLs.
