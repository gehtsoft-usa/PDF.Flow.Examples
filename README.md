# PDF.Flow

A PDF.Flow Library is a cross platform PDF SDK that transforms an abstract document model into a PDF document. The transformation includes creating pages and filling them with a content using specified layouts and automatic generation of repeating areas (such as headers and footers).

PDF.Flow itself is NOT an open source project, however:

1) The license allows to use this library in any open source or non-commercial project (however "non-commerical" means serving no purpose to get profit directly or indirectly, for example projects used in internal business processes of a commercial structure are considered commercial).

2) The license allows to use this library during prototyping, development and testing of a commerical project.

You should only purchase a commerical license only when the project goes alive. Please contact [Gehtsoft USA LLC](https://gehtsoftusa.com) to discuss the licensing. 

Please check the [project's Wiki](https://github.com/gehtsoft-usa/PDF.Flow.Examples/wiki) for useful articles and links.
